    "Below, you'll find a simple example of a machine learning workflow where we generate features from text data using count vectorizer and tf-idf transformer, and then fit it to a random forest classifier. Before we get into using pipelines, let's first use this example to go over some scikit-learn terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ESTIMATOR**: An [estimator](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/settings.html#estimators-objects) is any object that learns from data, whether it's a classification, regression, or clustering algorithm, or a transformer that extracts or filters useful features from raw data. Since estimators learn from data, they each must have a ***fit*** method that takes a dataset. In the example below, the *CountVectorizer*, *TfidfTransformer*, and *RandomForestClassifier* are all estimators, and each have a ***fit*** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRANSFORMER**: A [transformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html) is a specific type of estimator that has a ***fit*** method to learn from training data, and then a ***transform*** method to apply a transformation model to new data. These transformations can include cleaning, reducing, expanding, or generating features. In the example below, *CountVectorizer* and *TfidfTransformer* are transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PREDICTOR**: A **predictor** is a specific type of estimator that has a ***predict*** method to predict on test data based on a supervised learning algorithm, and has a ***fit*** method to train the model on training data. The final estimator, *RandomForestClassifier*, in the example below is a predictor.\n",
    "In machine learning tasks, it's pretty common to have a very specific sequence of transformers to fit to data before applying a final estimator, such as this classifier. And normally, we'd have to initialize all the estimators, ***fit*** and ***transform*** the training data for each of the transformers, and then fit to the final estimator. Next, we'd have to call transform for each transformer again to the test data, and finally call ***predict*** on the final estimator.\n",

Similarly, when we call ***predict*** on our pipeline to our test data, we're accomplishing what we would by calling ***transform*** on each of our transformer objects to our test data and then calling ***predict*** on our final estimator. Not only does this make our code much shorter and simpler, it has other great advantages, which we'll cover in the next video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every step of this pipeline has to be a transformer, except for the last step, which can be of an estimator type. Pipeline takes on all the methods of whatever the last estimator in its sequence is. For example, here, since the final estimator of our pipeline is a classifier, the pipeline object can be used as a classifier, taking on the ***fit*** and ***predict*** methods of its last step. Alternatively, if the last estimator was a transformer, then pipeline would be a transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Using Pipeline Part 1:\n",
    "1. Simplicity and Convencience\n",
    "- **Automates repetitive steps** - Chaining all of your steps into one estimator allows you to fit and predict on all steps of your sequence automatically with one call. It handles smaller steps for you, so you can focus on implementing higher level changes swiftly and efficiently.\n",
    "- **Easily understandable workflow** - Not only does this make your code more concise, it also makes your workflow much easier to understand and modify. Without Pipeline, your model can easily turn into messy spaghetti code from all the adjustments and experimentation required to improve your model.\n",
    "- **Reduces mental workload** - Because Pipeline automates the intermediate actions required to execute each step, it reduces the mental burden of having to keep track of all your data transformations. Using Pipeline may require some extra work at the beginning of your modeling process, but it prevents a lot of headaches later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Using Pipeline Part 2:\n",
    "2. Optimizing Entire Workflow\n",
    "- **GRID SEARCH**: Method that automates the process of testing different hyper parameters to optimize a model.\n",
    "By running grid search on your pipeline, you're able to optimize your entire workflow, including data transformation and modeling steps. This accounts for any interactions among the steps that may affect the final metrics.\n",
    "Without grid search, tuning these parameters can be painfully slow, incomplete, and messy.\n",
    "3. Preventing Data leakage\n",
    "Using Pipeline, all transformations for data preparation and feature extractions occur within each fold of the cross validation process.\n",
    "This prevents common mistakes where you’d allow your training process to be influenced by your test data - for example, if you used the entire training dataset to normalize or extract features from your data.\n",
    "You'll see what we mean by this in a video later in this lesson about using Pipeline with GridSearchCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipelines and Feature Unions\n",
    "- **FEATURE UNION**: Feature union is a class in scikit-learn’s Pipeline module that allows us to perform steps in parallel and take the union of their results for the next step.\n",
    "- A pipeline performs a list of steps in a linear sequence, while a feature union performs a list of steps in parallel and then combines their results.\n",
    "- In more complex workflows, multiple feature unions are often used within pipelines, and multiple pipelines are used within feature unions.\n",

Your first approach might be to create an additional column from the text column called text_length like this. Then both text and text_length can be part of your feature matrix. But now your pipeline would break. You can't run CountVectorizer on NumPy arrays of strings and integers."

Also like pipelines, feature unions combine a list of estimators to become a single estimator. However, a feature union runs its estimators in parallel, rather than in a sequence as a pipeline does. In this example, the estimators run in parallel are nlp_pipeline and text_length. Notice we use a pipeline in this feature union to make sure the count vectorizer and tfidf transformer steps are still running in sequence."

    "As mentioned earlier in the lesson, a powerful benefit to using pipeline is the ability to perform a grid search on your entire workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms have a set of parameters that need tuning. Grid search is a tool that allows you to define a “grid” of parameters, or a set of values to check. Your computer automates the process of trying out all possible combinations of values. Grid search scores each combination with cross validation, and uses the cross validation score to determine the parameters that produce the most optimal model.\n",

    "Running grid search on your pipeline allows you to try many parameter values thoroughly and conveniently, for both your data transformations and estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "And again, although you can also run grid search on just a single classifier, running it on your whole pipeline helps you test multiple parameter combinations across your entire pipeline. This accounts for interactions among parameters not just in your model, but data preparation steps as well.\n",

All you need to do is create a dictionary of parameters to search, using keys for the names of the parameters and values for the list of parameter values to check. Then, pass the model and parameter grid to the grid search object. Now when you call fit on this grid search object, it will run cross validation on all different combinations of these parameters to find the best combination of parameters for the model."
